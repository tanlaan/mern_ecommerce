Project Sheet for Intentional Practice in Full-Stack Development

**Project Description:**
Develop a custom e-commerce platform.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Front-end**: React (for building user interfaces)
- **Back-end**: Node.js with Express.js (for server-side logic)
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL database for storing product data, user profiles, etc.)
- **Additional Tools**: Git for version control, Docker for containerization, and AWS for deployment

**Project Milestones & Actionable Goals:**

1. **Project Setup (Week 1)**
   - Set up a GitHub repository for version control.
   - Create a basic project structure with React for the front-end and Node.js/Express.js for the back-end.
   - Initialize a MongoDB database.
   - Action Items: Install necessary software, initialize repositories, and document the setup process.

2. **User Authentication (Week 2-3)**
   - Implement user registration, login, and authentication features.
   - Set up user roles (admin, buyer, seller).

3. **Product Management (Week 4-6)**
   - Develop features for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting products.
   - Include image uploading capability for product images.
   - Action Items: Create CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs for products, integrate these with the front-end.

4. **Shopping Cart and Checkout Process (Week 7-9)**
   - Implement a shopping cart where users can add and remove products.
   - Create a checkout process with order confirmation.
   - Action Items: Develop shopping cart logic, design order database schema, implement order placement and tracking.

5. **Payment Gateway Integration (Week 10-11)**
